# Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Tasks
Tasks assignments for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis subject in HDip Data Analytics 2020-2021

This is for the four tasks in Fundamentals of Data Analysis subject. All code is written in Python and stored within a single Jupyter Notebook and should be run with Jupyter. 

The tasks were as follows:

### Task 1
The goal was to write a function called counts that takes a list as an input and returns a dictionary of the unique items in the list as keys with the values for each key being the number of times each item appeared in the list. Some explaination is provided on the function on what certain inputs could effect teh running or output of the function.

### Task 2
The task was to create a function called dicerolls for simulating rolling a 6 sided dice. The function took a quantity of dice to roll each time as well as the number of times to roll these dice. Some error handling is implented to handle different inputs. The function counts from task 1 is reused here to record the dice roll values.A graph is then provided of the output showing the spread of the values.

### Task 3
Code was written to simulate the flipping of a coin. This coin flip was done 100 times and the total heads recorded. This was then run 1000 times to get the spread of the total heads between 0 and 100. A graph is provided showing this spread. A section of code reuses a modified verison of the dicerolls function for simulating the dicerolls and another the numpy.random.binomial function.

### Task 4
This task was to create 4 datasets to demonstrate Simpons paradox which is a statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set.
